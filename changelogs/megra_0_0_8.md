# Changes for MÃ©gra Version 0.0.8:

* **BREAKING CHANGE** differentiation between `cyc` (time-slicing cycle) and `loop` (time-consecutive loop)
* both `loop` and `cyc` now accept shorthand- and pure s-expression syntax
* `loop` is now more flexible and accepts `:dur`, `:rep`, `:max-rep` and `:rnd` arguments directly, same as `cyc`
